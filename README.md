# Mayo Clinic Website Redesign - Accessible Delivery of Healthcare Information to Seniors
By Emily Dong



## Introduction

### Seniors need easier access to health information

According to the United Nations, the number of seniors (65+) is expected to double to 1.5 billion by 2050 globally. Despite seniors being one of the fastest-growing and most affluent demographic groups in wealthy countries, many digital products fail to meet senior accessibility needs and have excluded them from an online world that mostly caters to those with good eyesight, dexterity, and familiarity with the web. 

Health, in particular, is one of the major concerns among seniors, and we should ensure that information is accessible to them. For this project, I hope to demonstrate how we can improve user (patient) experiences on websites with health, healthcare, and patient information so that seniors can maintain their well-being. Additionally, by designing for their accessibility, we are designing for everyone's accessibility.

## Design Statement

### Preserving value while advocating for senior needs

[Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) is a non-profit American medical organization dedicated to clinical practice, education, and research, and is a trusted source of medical information about diseases and conditions across the world. The website is also used by patients to make appointments, access their patient account, and find information about receiving care. From my own observations, the richness of health information and breadth of features on the Mayo Clinic website can be both extremely valuable and overwhelming. **My goal is to preserve the value of Mayo Clinic's health information while streamlining people's ability to navigate throughout the website.** Not only would this better inform seniors on how to maintain their well-being, but would also reinforce Mayo Clinic's brand as a dependable, highly-ranked hospital.

## Research

### How usable is the Mayo website?

To identify usability issues on the Mayo Clinic webiste, I first conducted a **heuristic analysis** based on Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Overall, I found that because the Mayo Clinic website contains so much information, the main usability issues involve organizing the content and navigation in a way that is understandable for users, especially in terms of consistency & standards, flexibility & efficiency of use, and aesthetics & minimalist design. From an accessibility standpoint, they need to increase their font sizes and contrast between text and background, especially in the main navigation menu but also in other areas of their website.

Additionally, I conducted **usability testing (UT)** with a user. Due to limited formal testing space, the pilot UT was conducted in a minimalist portable test lab set up in a home setting.

Several pain points came up as a result of this test:

* **Lack of organization:** The huge amount of content on the website is indeed overwhelming. Long paragraphs discourage users from reading through. Information is not properly organized in a hierarchical manner, making information difficult to find, and leading to lower user engagement.

* **Lack of direction:** There are so many features on the website that just end up taking up space without ever being found, even if they might be useful to the user. The website needs to give the user more direction on where and how to navigate through the website.

* **Lack of consistency:** Some pages look different than others. Some pages can't be found using the search bar. Overall, it is easy for the user to get "lost" somewhere on the website. This all leads to poor brand perception of Mayo Clinic.

### Understanding the context in which seniors access health information

I also visited a senior user in their home and independently conducted **contextual inquiry** in order to gain a better sense of the environment in which seniors would normally access health information, to observe the user's usual health-search behavior and discover motivations and other pain points, and to clarify any observations made.

#### Key Insights

* **The user wants specific and detailed information.**
> *"...if I were create the website, then I will specific on what I know, or what I have been, have experience about it. So I concentrate on that one with deep detail.*

* **At the same time, they want to efficiently find information.**
> *"Sometimes some people write something that you think, "Oh, it's so much detail", ...and so hard to understand"*

* **The user wants the experience to feel personal.**
> *"...you need to look around to see which one is right for you and which one you think is acceptable... The one that first thing is, you feel like that version say something you think is right, for you."*

* **The user wants to ensure that they are making well-informed health choices.**
> *"You trust them or not? It's up to you."*
> *"If you need to do surgery for something, then better to search for the information, search for the second opinion. Should you do the surgery or not?"*

### Understanding how people group information about health and healthcare

Lastly, after conducting card-sorting of the homepage with a user, I found that:

* **'Health Information' as a term is too broad for the top navigation bar.** Anything on the website can be considered 'health information.' Therefore, the name of this item needs to be changed to something more specific.
* **'Education' can be used as a broader term to encompass their College of Medicine and Science as well as other programs that aren't necessarily part of that college.** For example, the Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development makes more sense under 'Education' than under 'College of Medicine and Science' (what they have now).

## UX Storytelling

### Designing for seniors, keeping in mind other users

Based on the insights I gained from usability testing and contextual inquiry, I created personas of a senior, less tech-savvy user named Vincent and of a younger, more tech-savvy user named Taylor. I wanted to ensure that we keep in mind other types of users because health information is accessed by a wide variety of people of all ages.

</p>

### Understanding the thought processes of those looking for health information

I also created empathy maps and user journeys to better empathize with how Vincent and Taylor may act when they are looking for health information. Specifically, I generated scenarios in which people would likely look for health information, again based on user interviews.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

### Finding ways to help users navigate through complex health information

In an attempt to satisfy the requirements of Vincent and Taylor, I ideated on a couple ideas that would address users' pain points by:
* Reorganizing and/or implementing features to make it easier find health information
* Utilizing a consistent design system to showcase Mayo Clinic as a professional brand
* Using graphics that produce a feeling of trustworthiness and personalization
* Directing them to a currently overlooked site (Mayo Clinic Connect) where they can communicate with other patients and caregivers

Some key features I ended up incorporating in my low-fidelity prototype (built using Whimsical) include:
1. **Clickable outline/overview:** Allows the user to quickly navigate to different parts of the article
2. **Breadcrumbs:** Displayed consistently at the top of each article; can be used as alternative navigation and gives the user a sense of where they are on the site
3. **Search feature within each health information subcategory (e.g. Diseases & Conditions, Symptoms, Tests & Procedures, Drugs & Supplements):** Allows the user to search by typing rather than only search by first letter
4. **Section that leads to Mayo Clinic Connect:** Briefly introduces the user to Mayo Clinic Connect and allows them to directly go on that site to discuss personal health-related stories with other patients and/or caregivers (as I understand, the main Mayo Clinic site currently does not have a link to Mayo Clinic Connect).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilydong001/DH110/main/Images/full-wireflow.png" alt="Full wireflow"/>
</p>

I then tested the prototype with a user to validate my design decisions and gain new insights. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilydong001/DH110/main/Images/lofi-testing-1.jpg" alt="User testing low-fidelity prototype" width="300px"/>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilydong001/DH110/main/Images/lofi-testing-2.jpg" width="300px"/>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilydong001/DH110/main/Images/lofi-testing-3.jpg" width="300px"/>
</p>

Specifically, I found that:

* **The user ignored the right side of the page for the most part due to ad placement.** They therefore had a hard time finding the Mayo Clinic Connect section. Features on the right need to have more visual contrast that separates the ad from the content of the page.

* **The user ignored the back-to-top button and opted to simply scroll instead.** The user mentioned that they are used to scrolling and tend to ignore back-to-top buttons, even though they are noticeable. We should include bottom navigation visually similar to the top navigation, which could eliminate the need for a back-to-top button. Back-to-top buttons can be reserved for extremely long pages. *Insights may be different for populations that are less used to scrolling or find it difficult to scroll through long pages.*

* **The user did not utilize the 'Health Information' tab in the main navigation at all. They would rather just search.** The user would rather search than use any other functionality, so the search function needs to be the most prominent and functional. 

* **The user finds the clickable outline helpful to navigate quickly throughout the article.** The user mentioned that they would normally just scroll and quickly scan the headlines of the article. However, they would find the clickable outline helpful when they scan too fast throughout the page and can't find what they are looking for.

## High-fidelity Prototype

### A consistent experience that empowers seniors to find reliable health information

This entire journey resulted in a website that would allow users of all types - not just seniors, but also people of all ages - to more efficiently find credible and detailed health information. Furthermore, the consistency of the design system makes it more clear that Mayo Clinic is a trustworthy and prfessional brand, and the use of more personal copy across the website makes the experience feel more personal. Altogether, this design could lead to higher user engagement, higher growth of new users, more efficient processes, and better brand perception of Mayo Clinic.

### Evaluation and Revision History

One user commented that the original placement of the clickable outline was difficult to see, though this may be due to the limited interactions that could be prototyped (e.g. the outline is not sticky). Still, in response to this, I removed the overview box and moved the outline up so that it is visible right under the secondary navigation bar. I also removed the box around the outline to make the interface less cluttered.

</p>

One user commented that they thought it felt like a business website - serious and professional. I did want the website to have that impression, but I also wanted the site to look more welcoming. Ideally, I would switch the landing page photo to one that captures a happier experience for the patient, but free stock photos on Unsplashs, Pexel, and other similar websites are limited in their selection of choices. I also made sure to round off the corners of all the buttons to emphasize the more friendly atmosphere. They also commented that it was difficult to see the language toggle at first, which is especially important for accessibility. In response to this, I moved the language option more towards the left so that the user can see it more readily in the top navigation:

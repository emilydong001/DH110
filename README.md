# Appropriately Delivering Health Information to Seniors

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Emily Dong | DH110 | Spring 2021

According to the United Nations, the number of seniors (65+) is expected to double to 1.5 billion by 2050 globally. Despite seniors being one of the fastest-growing and wealthiest demographics in wealthy countries, many digital products fail to meet senior accessibility needs and have made them feel excluded from an online world that is unfriendly to those with bad eyesight, declined dexterity, and unfamiliarity with the web. For this project, I hope to demonstrate how accurate, online health information can cater to the needs of seniors so that they can maintain their well-being. By designing for their accessibility, we can also make it easier for non-seniors to access health information as well.

# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

## Project Description

### Design Challenge

How might we make online health information more accessible for seniors so that they can make informed decisions about their personal health needs? 

:bulb: *See my process for developing this design challenge [here]().*

Specifically, I want to redesign the [Mayo Clinic website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) for seniors. This population is generally more vulnerable to health concerns, but is often ignored in website design despite becoming increasingly tech-savvy. I hope that by supporting senior accessibility to the wealth of reliable information on the website, seniors can better understand their physical and mental needs and plan for lifelong health.

### Target Users
The main focus of this project is to make health information on the Mayo Clinic website more accessible for seniors (65+), especially those with health conditions. However, I also want to ensure that the website is still usable for a diverse array of adult users, who may want to access health information for various reasons, including health concerns about themselves or their family/friends, general healthy lifestyle questions, etc.

## Research Methods
I visited a senior user and conducted contextual inquiry in order to gain a better sense of how the Mayo Clinic website could be redesigned to be more accessible for seniors. The session was held at the user's home, where they would normally access health information. Audio of the session was recorded with permission from the user.

The session included:
1. Background questions: To better understand when and where the user would access health information 
3. Observation: To observe the user's usual health-search behavior and discover motivations and pain points
4. Follow-up questions: To reveal any final thoughts about accessing health information and clarify any observations made

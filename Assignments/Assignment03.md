# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

## Project Description

### Design Challenge

How might we make online health information more accessible for seniors so that they can make informed decisions about their personal health needs? 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: *See my process for developing this design challenge [here]().*

Specifically, I want to redesign the [Mayo Clinic website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) for seniors. This population is generally more vulnerable to health concerns, but is often ignored in website design despite becoming increasingly tech-savvy. I hope that by supporting senior accessibility to the wealth of reliable information on the website, seniors can better understand their physical and mental needs and plan for lifelong health.

### Target Users
The main focus of this project is to make health information on the Mayo Clinic website more accessible for seniors (65+), especially those with health conditions. However, I also want to ensure that the website is still usable for a diverse array of adult users who may want to access health information for various reasons, including health concerns about themselves or their family/friends, general healthy lifestyle questions, etc.

## Research Methods
I visited a senior, minority-group user and conducted contextual inquiry in order to gain a better sense of the environment in which seniors would normally access health information and to use those insights in redesigning the Mayo Clinic website to be more accessible for them. The session was held at the user's home, and audio of the session was recorded and transcribed using Otter.ai with permission from the user. Field notes and observations of user behavior were taken on a laptop.

The session included:
1. **Background questions:** To better understand when and where the user would access health information 
2. **Observation:** To observe the user's usual health-search behavior and discover motivations and pain points
3. **Follow-up questions:** To reveal any final thoughts about accessing health information and clarify any observations made

## Reflection

### Insights from the Interview
A few key points came up during the interview:

:bulb: **The user wants a personal, specific, and easy experience. Information needs to be presented clearly and relevantly.**
* "Sometimes some people write something that you think, "Oh, it's so much detail", you know, and so hard to understand or some kind of requirement that you want to treat it is very difficult to do..."

* "What I like [is that they put] a title. So easy for you to search and they may have a subtitle."

* "...if I were create the website, then I will specific on what I know, or what I have been, have experience about it. So I concentrate on that one with deep detail."

:bulb: **The user wants up-to-date information from multiple sources so that they can make informed health choices for themself.** 
* "So you need to look around to see which one is right for you and which one you think is acceptable... The one that first thing is, you feel like that version say something you think is right, for you."

* "You go online to see other people may have their own experience."

* "If you need to do surgery for something, then better to search for the information, search for the second opinion. Should you do the surgery or not?"

:bulb: **Healthcare providers need to be well-integrated with the online experience.**
* "...sometimes you get your doctor first. Because he knew about your condition better than yourself. Cause he has all your records."

# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

## Project Description

### Design Challenge

How might we make online health information more accessible for seniors so that they can make informed decisions about their personal health needs? 

Specifically, I want to redesign the [Mayo Clinic website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) to be more usable for seniors. This population is generally more vulnerable to health concerns, but is often ignored in website design despite becoming increasingly tech-savvy. I hope that by supporting senior accessibility to the wealth of credible information on the website, they can better understand their physical and mental needs and plan for lifelong health.

### Target Users
The main focus of this project is to make health information on the Mayo Clinic website more accessible for seniors (65+), especially those with health conditions. However, I also want to ensure that the website is still usable for a diverse array of adult users who may want to access health information for various reasons, including health concerns about themselves or their family/friends, general healthy lifestyle questions, etc.

## Research Methods
I visited a senior, minority-group user and independently conducted contextual inquiry in order to gain a better sense of the environment in which seniors would normally access health information and to use those insights in redesigning the Mayo Clinic website to be more accessible for them. The session was therefore held at the user's home, and audio of the session was recorded and transcribed using Otter.ai on my phone with permission from the user. Field notes and observations of user behavior were taken on a laptop.
 
The interview included:
1. **Background questions:** To better understand when and where the user would access health information 
2. **Observation:** To observe the user's usual health-search behavior and discover motivations and pain points
3. **Follow-up questions:** To reveal any final thoughts about accessing health information and clarify any observations made

## Reflection

### Key Insights from the Interview

:bulb: **The user wants the experience to feel personal, specific, and efficient. Detailed information needs to be presented clearly and relevantly.**
* "Sometimes some people write something that you think, "Oh, it's so much detail", you know, and so hard to understand or some kind of requirement that you want to treat it is very difficult to do..."

* "...if I were create the website, then I will specific on what I know, or what I have been, have experience about it. So I concentrate on that one with deep detail."

:bulb: **The user wants up-to-date information from multiple sources so that they can make informed health choices for themself.** 
* "So you need to look around to see which one is right for you and which one you think is acceptable... The one that first thing is, you feel like that version say something you think is right, for you."

* "You go online to see other people may have their own experience."

* "If you need to do surgery for something, then better to search for the information, search for the second opinion. Should you do the surgery or not?"

:bulb: **Healthcare providers should be well-integrated in the online experience.**
* "...sometimes you get your doctor first. Because he knew about your condition better than yourself."

### Personal Insights
Performing contextual inquiry really helped me empathize with how a senior user feels and what they think about as they are searching for health information, and it gave me new insights (see above) that I will take into account when I redesign the Mayo Clinic website. It was especially eye-opening to see the perspective of a minority-group user whose first language isn't English, as I could directly observe how much they struggled with websites that use text that is too small, terminology that is too complicated, and long paragraphs that don't utilize proper hierarchy and typography to emphasize key points in the articles. Of course, complicated terms can sometimes be unavoidable in a medical context, but websites providing health and healthcare information should still try to simplify their explanations and use transparent terminology as much as possible. Designing with these needs in mind, we can make the search for health information easier for the general population as well.

The contextual inquiry process itself went quite smoothly, but there were a few important lessons I learned. I determined that you can never really prepare completely for the interview; conversations happen organically, and in order to ensure that the user feels comfortable, we have to find a balance between the natural flow of a conversation and the agenda we set to find answers to our questions, and this can only be done with more practice. Also, I realized that because the first language of the user I interviewed was not English, some of the statements he made were somewhat ambiguous, and next time I should clarify any points of confusion as soon as they appear. Lastly, I learned the importance of validating my own assumptions and truly understanding the user's needs and goals. For example, on  before this interview, I hadn't considered how important it was for patient users to be engaged with healthcare decision-making and to feel heard as they make choices about their own bodies and lifestyle. Now that I realize that, I can try to incorporate that idea and create a better digital experience in the redesign.

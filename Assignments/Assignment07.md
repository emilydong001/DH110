# Assignment07: High-Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to increase accessibility to health information from the widely-trusted [Mayo Clinic website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/). The website was redesigned based on new branding guidelines for Mayo Clinic that have only been implemented in the most recent pages added to the website, such as their COVID-19

## Tasks Supported
1. Using the clickable outline to navigate directly to topic of interest
2. Back-to-top button only at the end of very long pages
3. Clicking on button (under clickable outline) to navigate to Mayo Clinic Connect
5. Searching for information about 'arthritis' or 'diabetes' on main navigation or Diseases & Conditions page
6. Hovering over 'Health Topics' to reveal a large menu with subcategories, and navigating to Diseases & Conditions page from there
7. Using breadcrumbs to navigate to Diseases & Conditions page
8. Clicking 'Request an Appointment' button across multiple pages
9. Navigating back to homepage using logo

Ideally, I would have made the clickable outline sticky so that it follows the user as they scroll down the page, which may eliminate the need for the back-to-top button. However, Figma does not currently support sticky elements past the fold line.

## Interactive Prototype

## Wireflow
Here's a snapshot of the full wireflow:

</p>

I also made 'zoomed-in' versions to more clearly depict certain parts of the flow. Some interactions are missing to make the snapshot more clear; for example, all the logos in the prototype navigate back to the homepage, but that is not shown in these 'zoomed-in' versions. 

This one shows the search flow from the homepage to either the diseases & conditions page or directly to the search results for 'arthritis', and then from the search results to the health information page for arthritis.

This one shows navigation through the arthritis page using the clickable outline and the back-to-top button, as well as navigation to the Mayo Clinic Connect page and the Request Appointment page.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

## Iterations
One user commented that the original placement of the clickable outline was difficult to see, though this may be due to the limited interactions that could be prototyped (e.g. the outline is not sticky). Still, in response to this, I removed the overview box and moved the outline up so that it is visible right under the secondary navigation bar.

  <img src="../Images/diabetes-page-after.PNG" alt="Diabetes page after changing position of clickable outline" width="450px"/>
</p>

One user commented that they thought it felt like a business website - serious and professional. I did want the website to have that impression, but I also wanted the site to look more welcoming. Ideally, I would switched the landing page photo to one that captures a happier experience for the patient, but free stock photos on Unsplashs, Pexel, and other similar websites are limited in their selection of choices. I also made sure to round off the corners of all the buttons to emphasize the more friendly atmosphere (see before and after images of top navigation below).

One user also commented that it was difficult to see the language toggle at first, which is especially important for accessibility. In response to this, I moved the language option more towards the left so that the user can see it more readily in the top navigation:

# Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing

## Introduction

### About the Project
[Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) is a non-profit American medical organization dedicated to clinical practice, education, and research. They are a well-known and trusted source of medical information about diseases and conditions, symptoms, drugs and supplements, tests and procedures, and healthy living. Patients of Mayo Clinic can also use the website to make appointments, access their patient account, and find information about receiving healthcare. 

After conducting a [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/emilydong001/DH110/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md) of the Mayo Clinic desktop website, I identified several usability concerns that should be addressed. In terms of flexibility and efficiency of use, many pages needed better grouping and hierarchy to allow users to more conveniently find the information that was relevant to them. In terms of aesthetic and minimalist design, there were unnecessary, repeated elements scattered throughout the pages, and the font was often much too small to be accessible for seniors and other visually-impaired users. Finally, in terms of consistency and standards, different sections of the website had different layouts, fonts, styles, and functionality, making it confusing for the user. Overall, because of the richness of content and breadth of features available on the Mayo Clinic website, most of the issues involved organizing the content and navigation in a way that would better serve the users.

### The Purpose of Usability Testing

**Usability testing (UT)** is needed in order to confirm these concerns and perhaps identify other usability issues that may diminish the user experience. By observing where users encounter problems or points of confusion while performing a set of tasks, we can identify opportunities to improve elements of the website, app, or other product. Furthermore, UT allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of the user's perspective, and with these insights, we can create products that not only meet users' needs, but are also competitive in the market. If usability testing is done early and often throughout product development, we minimize the need to correct mistakes down the road, saving stakeholders a lot of time, money, and effort. 

## Methodology
The pilot UT was conducted in a minimalist portable test lab set up in a home setting. A laptop was used to record the user's facial expressions and interactions with the website and another laptop for the participant to fill out the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKkK4JFiPDIyvAw645oKG36WBJO_igeXGJS6PRohB4tHtyTA/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

The usability test and website of interest was first introduced to the participant, and the participant was given an informed consent form to sign. Then, pre-test questions regarding the user's previous experience with the website or their first impressions of the website were given to determine their

Keeping in mind the usability concerns mentioned before, the participant was asked to perform 3 tasks:
1. Using the symptom checker, finding the disease/condition causing those symptoms, and finding what types of treatment are available for that disease/condition.
2. Finding the types of insurance Mayo Clinic accepts from patients.
3. Finding information about vitamin D supplements, including who may need to take vitamin D supplements, possible side effects, and daily recommended intake of vitamin D.

## Materials

The questionnaire consisted of the following components:
* Introduction script
* Informed consent
* Background questions
* Previous experience (if applicable)
* Pre-test questions
* Tasks
* Post-test questions
  * System Usability Scale (SUS)
  * Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographic questions
